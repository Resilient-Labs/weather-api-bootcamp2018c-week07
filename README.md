How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, es6 JS

I used this project to get more practice with using classes in JS. I actually enjoyed making this project but closer to the end my code design started getting messy. I think in the future I need to spend more time sudo coding and mapping out what the infrastructure of my code should look like for myself on a piece of paper.


Lessons Learned:
I need to brush up on constructors
